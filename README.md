# COOKING1
A simple version of Overcooked 2 for the Casio fx-CG50 written in CASIO BASIC with some additional tweaks.

## Creating .txt files
Run `python3 AdvancedCompile.py` to create the `COOKING1.txt` file. This needs to be copied to the calculators main storage (`@MainMem/PROGRAMS/`)

**Experimental**: Run `python3 Schema2List.py` to create the `Level1.list` file. This is kinda experimental because the calculator has constant values instead of a custom lookup-table. **Use with caution!**
